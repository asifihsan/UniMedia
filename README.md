# UniMedia
## Problem Description
UniMedia a college event book. Here Admin can post new upcoming events going happen in college. It can be also considered as a online Notice Board. It is an webapp using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript that helps student to know latest updates and events happening in college.

## Motivation
I am passionate about this project because, In our campus its bit difficult to know about events. And there is Instagram pages that will post about events but its though to refer all the pages and people who don't use Instagram its bit difficult. So from that i have got thought develop it.
